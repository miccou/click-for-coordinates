# Click for Coordinates

Click for Coordinates is a web application that allows users to generate a list of coordinates by clicking on a map. Users can choose to display the coordinates in either JSON or CSV format, and copy the list to their clipboard for use in other applications.

## Usage

To use Click for Coordinates, open the application in your web browser and click on the map to add coordinates. You can add as many coordinates as you like by clicking on different points on the map. A line will indicate the order in which points have been clicked.

Once you've added all of the coordinates you need, you can choose to display them in either JSON or CSV format by clicking the appropriate button. The formatted list of coordinates will be displayed on the left of the screen, and you can copy it to your clipboard by clicking the "Copy" button.
